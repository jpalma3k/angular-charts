<!--
Why <canvas> tag should be inside <div> tag, in Short:
The HTML5 Canvas element is an HTML tag similar to the <div>, <a>, or <table> tag,
with the exception that its contents are rendered with JavaScript. 
In order to leverage the HTML5 Canvas, we'll need to place the canvas tag somewhere inside
the HTML document, access the canvas tag with JavaScript, create a context, and then utilize 
the HTML5 Canvas API to draw visualizations.
